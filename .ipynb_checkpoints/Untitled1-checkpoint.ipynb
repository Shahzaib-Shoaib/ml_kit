    "### Understanding Your Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Before starting any machine learning project, it's essential to understand the structure and characteristics of your data. This step helps you identify key features, data types, missing values, correlations, and any potential issues such as duplicates or outliers. Understanding your data allows you to make informed decisions for preprocessing and model building.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Use Cases:\n",
    "- **Shape & Overview**: Helps in getting a quick idea about the size of the dataset and the types of features it contains.\n",
    "- **Missing Values**: Identifies if there are missing values that need to be handled.\n",
    "- **Descriptive Statistics**: Summarizes basic statistical properties like mean, standard deviation, and percentiles.\n",
    "- **Correlation**: Shows relationships between features, useful for feature selection and detecting multicollinearity.\n",
    "- **Duplicates**: Identifies duplicate records that might need to be removed for better data quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Things to Keep in Mind:\n",
    "- **Missing Data**: Be sure to handle missing values appropriately (impute or remove) to avoid data leakage.\n",
    "- **Outliers**: Investigate whether the dataset has outliers that need to be treated.\n",
    "- **Data Types**: Ensure that your features have the correct data types (e.g., categorical, numerical) for further processing.\n",
    "- **Duplicate Data**: Always check for duplicate rows to avoid skewing your results.\n",
    "- **Correlations**: Highly correlated features can lead to multicollinearity, which may degrade model performance.\n",

    "By performing these checks, you gain a solid understanding of the data and can proceed with preprocessing and feature engineering confidently.\n"
