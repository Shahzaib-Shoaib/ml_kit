# Machine Learning and NLP Learning Plan

## Step 1: Understanding the Basics
1. What is Machine Learning?
2. Understanding Your Data
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
4. Pandas Profiling for quick EDA

## Step 2: Data Preprocessing
1. Handling Missing Data
   - Simple Imputer for numerical and categorical data
   - Missing Indicator
   - KNN Imputer
   - MICE (Multivariate Imputation by Chained Equations)
2. Feature Scaling
   - Standardization
   - Normalization (MinMaxScaling, MaxAbsScaling, RobustScaling)
3. Encoding Categorical Data
   - Ordinal Encoding
   - Label Encoding
   - One Hot Encoding
4. Handling Date and Time Variables
5. Handling Mixed Variables

## Step 3: Feature Engineering
1. Feature Construction and Splitting
2. Function Transformer (Log, Reciprocal, Square Root Transforms)
3. Power Transformer (Box-Cox, Yeo-Johnson Transforms)
4. Binning and Binarization (Discretization, Quantile Binning, KMeans Binning)

## Step 4: Handling Imbalanced Data
1. Undersampling
2. Oversampling
3. SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)

## Step 5: Outlier Detection and Treatment
1. Z-score Method
2. IQR Method
3. Percentile Method and Winsorization

## Step 6: Model Building and Evaluation
1. Understand Bias-Variance Tradeoff
2. Implement basic models (e.g., Linear Regression, Logistic Regression)
3. Evaluate models using appropriate metrics:
   - Regression Metrics: MSE, MAE, RMSE, R2 Score, Adjusted R2 Score
   - Classification Metrics: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Precision, Recall, F1 Score

## Step 7: Advanced Modeling Techniques
1. Ensemble Learning
   - Bagging
   - Boosting
   - Stacking and Blending

## Step 8: Machine Learning Pipelines
1. Column Transformer
2. Creating end-to-end ML pipelines

## Step 9: Natural Language Processing (NLP) Basics
1. Text preprocessing (tokenization, lowercasing, removing punctuation)
2. Stop word removal
3. Stemming and Lemmatization
4. Bag of Words (BoW) and TF-IDF

## Step 10: Advanced NLP Techniques
1. Word Embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe)
2. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for sequence modeling
3. Transformer models (BERT, GPT)

## Additional Important Algorithms to Learn:
1. Linear Regression
2. Logistic Regression
3. Decision Trees
4. Random Forests
5. Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM)
6. Support Vector Machines (SVM)
7. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
8. K-Means Clustering
9. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
10. Naive Bayes (for NLP tasks)

## Practical Tips:
1. Start with a small, end-to-end project to apply these concepts
2. Use scikit-learn for most ML tasks and NLTK or spaCy for NLP tasks
3. Practice on public datasets (e.g., from Kaggle) before your competition
4. Document your code and experiments thoroughly
5. Collaborate with your teammate, dividing tasks based on strengths
